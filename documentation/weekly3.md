# Weekly report 3

This week I implemented a simple text UI to test the functionalities. I also built a simple AI class to allow the user to play against the algorithm. The AI will adjust its strategy every time the user chooses an action. It also allows you to see its current strategy and also the next move it will choose (this way no cheating can occur).

Next I will start implementing the graphical ui and try to get my algorithm working with some more complex games too.
