# Weekly report #1

This week I was looking for an interesting subject for my project. As game theory and solving games has always interested me, I looked into regret matching and counterfactual regret minimization (CFR). I had no previous knowledge of the algorithms, so I spent hours on studying and trying to understand them. After some studying, I came to the conclusion CFR might be too complicated to fully implement in the time frame of this particular course.

So I settled on regret matching, and will be using Rock-Paper-Scissors as the base game I will be solving (although I intend to build my algorithm in a way that makes it general use, where the rules of the game could be given as input).

I also set up the project repository, wrote the definition document and completed all the other tasks required for this week.

Time spent: 8h
