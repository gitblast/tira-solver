# Weekly report 4

This week I tried doing some research on how to make the project more complex by implementing the counterfactual regret algorithm. I read a bunch on the subject and will be trying to get it running next week.

I also started writing the implementation document, finishing the part about regret matching. Tried starting the testing document too, couldn't really find good examples and not really sure what it needs to contain. Will look into it next week.
